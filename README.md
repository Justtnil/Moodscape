# Moodscapes
Moodscape is a modern, offline-first mood journaling application for Android, built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It's designed to be a private, personal sanctuary for users to track their emotional landscape, discover patterns, and reflect on their well-being without relying on the cloud.
