# Moodscape üåÑ

**A modern, offline-first mood journaling application for Android, built with 100% Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.**

## About The Project

Moodscape is designed as a private, personal sanctuary for users to track their emotional landscape, discover patterns, and reflect on their well-being without relying on the cloud. All data is stored locally on-device, ensuring the app is 100% functional without an internet connection and that your personal information remains yours alone.

This project serves as a comprehensive case study in modern Android development, focusing on robust architecture, user-centric features, and a steadfast commitment to privacy.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Journaling
* **Daily Mood Logging:** Log your mood with a custom emoji, a detailed note, and a score (1-5).
* **Visual Calendar:** A clean, full-screen calendar provides an at-a-glance heatmap of your mood history.
* **Customization:** Add, edit, and delete your own moods with unique emojis and names.
* **Categories (Backend):** The database supports tagging entries with categories like "Work" or "Health" for future analysis.

### Advanced Functionality
* **Offline Voice-to-Text:** Use the on-device `SpeechRecognizer` to dictate notes directly into your mood entries, completely offline.
* **Intelligent Reminders:** A `WorkManager`-powered background service schedules a daily notification to remind you to log your mood, but *only* if you haven't already.
* **Mood Logbook:** A dedicated screen to view, scroll, and filter your entire mood history by various time ranges (7, 14, 30, 90 days).

### Data & Insights
* **Secure Data Export:** Export your mood log for a selected time range as a PDF file directly to your device's storage using the Storage Access Framework.
* **Rule-Based Insights Engine:** An offline analysis engine that calculates and displays meaningful insights from your data, including:
    * Weekly mood trends.
    * Correlations between moods and days of the week.
    * Keyword clustering in notes for less positive moods.
